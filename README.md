Automatic-Garden-Waterer
========================

A project that switches a valve to water plants in the garden. It has a manual switch to control the valve or a MSP430 microcontroller used as a timer attached to a relay to automatically turn the valve off after a adjustable amount of time.

It uses a modified PCB from my [MSP430-Reaction-Game](https://github.com/dwaq/MSP430-Reaction-Game) project.

Schematic files created using Cadsoft EAGLE 6.2.0. Code compiled using Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio Core Edition 4.2.5.
